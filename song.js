/*
* The Lazy Song" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars for his debut studio album Doo-Wops & Hooligans (2010).
* It was serviced to contemporary hit radios in the United States on February 15, 2011 as the album's third single by Atlantic and Elektra.
* Development of "The Lazy Song" began while Bruno Mars, Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine were hanging around the studio and didnâ€™t feel like working.
*    Mars wrote the song in collaboration with singer-songwriter K'naan and his production team The Smeezingtons, who also produced the track.
* Musically, "The Lazy Song" has been described as borrowing "heavily from roots reggae", while lyrically it is an anthem to laziness.
